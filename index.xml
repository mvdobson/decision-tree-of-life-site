      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Decision Tree of Life is a free tool for getting more of what you want. The tree guides you through five questions. Two of the questions are optional but generally recommended. All the questions are simple but answering them might be hard. Help with each question is below. Keep in mind that you and your circumstances will probably change through the years, and those changes will probably make you want different things or want things differently. Also know that wanting contradictory things at the same time is normal and will complicate matters. Adjusting wants as they change and come into conflict is a continuous process. Refer to this decision tree as needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
